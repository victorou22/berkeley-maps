# berkeley-maps

I wrote the Java backend for a Google Maps-like application that renders a dynamic map of UC Berkeley area using data from OpenStreetMaps. The application supports finding and drawing the shortest route between two user-selected points, just like Google Maps. The map is implemented using a quadtree for map rendering/zooming and A* search algorithm for path-finding.
